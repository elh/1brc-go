# 1brc-go

Parse and aggregate 1B rows of text very quickly using Go for the [1BRC challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc).

Mainly done as an excuse to play around with `pprof`.

## Performance

On Jan 14, as measured on my 2023 Apple M2 Pro Macbook with 1brc's `evaluate.sh` script, this performs very competitively against the top Java and Go submissions. At the very least this means, I have put in some effort optimizing this for the machine I have in front of me. There is a pretty funny lesson to be learned here that everyone's solution is the fastest on their own machine :)

Props to AlexanderYastrebov who is pushing on enabling language agnostic solutions in the leaderboard. Very curious now to see where this stacks up if I can run it on the test environment. I haven't looked at other Go solution code yet, but the discussion his started would motivate me to write my own.

```bash
make evaluate
# Benchmark 1: ./bin/1brc-go 2>&1
#   Time (mean ¬± œÉ):      6.626 s ¬±  0.170 s    [User: 38.109 s, System: 3.072 s]

## Usage

```bash
# builds the go executable and runs the following test
make run

# Result:
# ./bin/1brc-go  37.90s user 3.98s system 590% cpu 7.089 total
diff measurements.out <(time ./bin/1brc-go)

# takes an optional single command line arg for the measurements file path. If not provided, defaults to `measurements.txt`
# PROFILE is optional and enables profiling if "true"
go run main.go
```

Add a gitignore-d `measurements.txt` file in the project root or use command line arg to override the path.

## Log
Times measured on 2023 Apple M2 Pro Macbook with 10 cores and 16GB RAM.

* 140s - Naive implementation. Reading lines with `Scanner.Text`.
* 83s - Using `Scanner.ReadSlice` to reduce a massive string allocation.
* 54s - Using `file.Read` directly and avoided some `bytes` helper functions to iterate bytes in a single scan.
* 45s - Using a far larger buffer to reduce IO latency. Removed a redundant map lookup. Using `unsafe.String` to avoid additional string allocs.
* 35s - Implemented a custom, simplified replacement for `strconv.ParseFloat`.
    * Most of the time just goes into scanning byte slices. Biggest other bottleneck is `map[string]*Stats` lookups. Decently pleased with single threaded optimizations so now making it concurrent.
* 7s - Concurrently read and parse the file as byte index addressed chunks, then merge results in a single final goroutine. See tunable `numParsers` and `parseChunkSize` parameters.

### Ideas
* Optimize concurrency.
    * Pipeline more work.
    * Tune concurrency and read buffer size parameters. I picked current values for my machine very quickly and unscientifically.
* Custom map/set implementation for string->float
* Memory arena (or other optimizations of locality)?
* Faster way to iterate bytes?
